//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS
start seaching nodes closest to parent

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS
(DFS) will take too long with deep tree

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS
(BFS) will take too much memory
  needs to track all nodes at a level in a queue

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS
DFS is built for this

//Finding the shortest path:
BFS
